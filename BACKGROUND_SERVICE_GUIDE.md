# Pomodoro Background Service Integration

## Overview

The Pomodoro app now features a complete background service integration that allows the timer to continue running even when:
- The app is closed/backgrounded
- The device screen is turned off
- The app is swiped out of recents (on some devices)

This makes it a real Pomodoro timer that feels professional and reliable.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **BackgroundService** (`lib/background_service.dart`)
   - Manages all background timer operations
   - Uses WorkManager for periodic background task scheduling
   - Persists timer state to SharedPreferences
   - Calculates elapsed time and updates timer in background

2. **TimerScreen** (`lib/timer_screen.dart`)
   - Integrated with BackgroundService for state persistence
   - Saves timer state on pause, resume, stop, and navigation
   - Restores timer state when app returns from background
   - Logs all timer operations for debugging

3. **PomodoroService** (`lib/pomodoro_service.dart`)
   - Audio playback management
   - Local notifications
   - State persistence (enhanced with background service)

### How It Works

#### Timer Lifecycle

1. **Start Timer**
   - User presses "START SESSION" → TimerScreen initializes
   - App checks for saved timer state (e.g., from previous session)
   - If found, restores the timer with elapsed time calculated
   - If not, starts fresh 25-minute work session
   - BackgroundService saves initial state with timestamp

2. **During Countdown**
   - Timer counts down every second in foreground
   - Every second, state is saved (timestamp + remaining time)
   - BackgroundService registered for periodic checks (every 15 seconds)
   - Focus music plays continuously

3. **When App Goes to Background**
   - Current timer state saved with precise timestamp
   - Background task scheduler takes over
   - Background task runs periodically to:
     - Calculate elapsed time from last update
     - Update remaining time
     - Check if timer has expired
     - Show notifications if needed

4. **When App Returns**
   - TimerScreen loads saved state
   - Calculates how much time elapsed while backgrounded
   - Adjusts timer accordingly
   - Resumes countdown seamlessly
   - Music resumes playing

5. **Timer Expires**
   - Completion sound plays
   - Notification displayed
   - Phase switches (Work ↔ Break)
   - Next phase timer starts automatically
   - All handled both in foreground and background

#### State Storage

Timer state stored in SharedPreferences:
```
pomodoro_time_remaining: int     // Seconds remaining (0-1500)
pomodoro_is_working: bool        // true for work, false for break
pomodoro_timer_active: bool      // true if timer running, false if paused
pomodoro_last_timestamp: int     // Milliseconds since epoch when last updated
```

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Starting a Session**
   ```
   Home Screen → Press "START SESSION"
   → Timer Screen appears with 25-minute work session
   ```

2. **While Timer is Running**
   - Press pause icon: pauses timer and saves state
   - Press play icon: resumes from saved time
   - Press stop icon: cancels session and returns to home
   - Back button: saves state and returns to home
   - Minimize app: timer continues in background
   - Close app: timer continues in background
   - Turn off screen: timer continues in background

3. **Returning to App**
   - Open app while timer was backgrounded
   - Timer automatically restores with time adjustment
   - Continues from where it left off

### For Developers

#### Initializing Background Service

```dart
// In main.dart or app initialization
await BackgroundService.initialize();
```

#### Saving Timer State

```dart
// When pausing, stopping, or navigating away
await BackgroundService.saveTimerState(
  timeRemaining: 1200,  // seconds
  isWorking: true,      // work phase or break phase
  isActive: true,       // timer running or paused
);
```

#### Loading Timer State

```dart
// When resuming app
final state = await BackgroundService.loadTimerState();
if (state != null && state['isActive'] == true) {
  // Calculate elapsed time
  final elapsed = await BackgroundService.getElapsedSeconds();
  final newTime = state['timeRemaining'] - elapsed;
  // Use newTime to resume timer
}
```

#### Stopping Background Service

```dart
// When user stops timer completely
await BackgroundService.stopBackgroundTask();
```

## Technical Details

### WorkManager Configuration

- **Task ID**: `pomodoro_timer`
- **Frequency**: Every 15 seconds
- **Constraints**: None (runs regardless of connectivity, battery state, etc.)
- **Flexibility**: Allows system to optimize timing

### Permissions

**Android Manifest** (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

### Dependencies

```yaml
workmanager: ^0.9.3      # Background task scheduling
intl: ^0.19.0            # Internationalization support
shared_preferences: ^2.5.3  # State persistence
flutter_local_notifications: ^19.5.0  # Notifications
audioplayers: ^6.5.1     # Audio playback
```

## Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

The app includes comprehensive debug logs tagged with:
- `[BackgroundService]` - Background service operations
- `[TimerScreen]` - UI timer operations

View logs with:
```bash
flutter run --verbose
# or in logcat
adb logcat | grep "BackgroundService\|TimerScreen"
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Timer doesn't resume after app close
- **Solution**: Ensure `saveTimerState()` is called in `dispose()` and when navigating away

**Issue**: Timer loses accuracy over long backgrounds
- **Solution**: Timestamp-based calculation in `getElapsedSeconds()` accounts for this

**Issue**: Notifications not showing
- **Solution**: Check that `PomodoroService().initializeNotifications()` is called in `initState()`

**Issue**: Background task not running
- **Solution**: Check Android permissions and WorkManager logs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Foreground Service Notification**
   - Add persistent notification while timer runs
   - Quick actions (pause, resume) in notification

2. **Advanced State Recovery**
   - Track multiple paused sessions
   - Resume from app crash

3. **Analytics**
   - Track completed sessions
   - Productivity statistics

4. **Customization**
   - User-configurable work/break durations
   - Multiple preset profiles

5. **iOS Support**
   - BackgroundTasks framework integration
   - VoIP push for wake-up
